All things considered, a job very well done.
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it. 
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.
Up there with the best of Melville. 
Everything about this film is simply incredible.
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.
Very awful food.
I dislike the environment
My hated the look of the food
