Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.
Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.
Definitely a bargain.
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.
Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).
